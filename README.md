# FitConnect
Gym centered social media platform
I worked on this project with two other people.
This website interacts with a sql server to store the needed data. 
The main page was a templete provided by my professor, but besides that everything is out own.
I am currently working on my own front page that will look more like a social media platfom and will support the upload and veiwing of photos and videos.
The website stores the user session so when they login to their accout. They can post from their account view their feed and their own account.
The users password is stored through a hash.
In the relations section there is some of the tables we use to store data.
In the Queries section there are some example sql queries.
In the Ad-hoc Query section will accept any sql query including insert create etc. If the query dosnt work, because the table is missing or a query was typed incorrectly then it will say there is an error and to try again.
